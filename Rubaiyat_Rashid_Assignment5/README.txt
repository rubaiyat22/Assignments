I. Parts Completed
	- All parts of this assignment were completed 

II. Bugs Encountered
	- None

III. Instructions on Running program
	- Compilation: ‘make’ or ‘make all’
	- Run:
		<> make run1a to test part 1 with Graph1.txt and AdjacencyQueries1.txt
		<> make run1b to test part 1 with Graph2.txt and AdjacencyQueries2.txt

		<> make run2a to test part 2 with Graph1.txt and 1
		<> make run2b to test part 2 with Graph2.txt and 1
		<> make run2c to test part 2 with Graph3.txt and 1
		
		<> make run3a to test part 3 with Graph1.txt
		<> make run3a to test part 3 with Graph2.txt
		<> make run3a to test part 3 with Graph3.txt

				
	- Clean:
		<> make clean - cleans CreateGraphAndTest.o, CreateGraphAndTest,  FindPaths.o, FindPaths , 
			TopologicalSort.o, and TopologicalSort
